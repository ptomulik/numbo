HOWTO: maintain translations
````````````````````````````


Translations are maintained with gettext_ utilities. To automate
things, we use scons_ `gettext tool`_, which is first included in version
``2.2.0`` of scons.

.. note::

    You need at least version ``2.2.1`` of scons to mainain translations
    properly. The version ``2.2.0`` has a bug, and is not usable for projects
    with multiple ``po/`` directories.

Translations are keept in files located under ``po/`` subdirectories in several
places of the project, for example ``src/lib/numbo/app/clinfo/po/`` contains
translations for the ``libnumbo_clinfo`` library for which the sources are
located under ``src/lib/numbo/app/clinfo/``.

Each ``po/`` subdirectory contains following files:

=================   ==============================================================
 File                Description
=================   ==============================================================
 ``POTFILES.in``     a list of source (e.g. ``.cpp``) files to extract
                     translation strings from, the format is same as in
                     automake based projects,
-----------------   --------------------------------------------------------------
 ``LINGUAS``         list of target languages to produce translations for; the
                     format is same as in automake based projects,
-----------------   --------------------------------------------------------------
 ``messages.pot``    a template file with strings, that are to be translated;
                     the ``messages.pot`` are updated when translation strings
                     in source files (listed in ``POTFILES.in``) change,
-----------------   --------------------------------------------------------------
 ``.po`` files       several ``.po`` files being maintained, one per target
                     language; the ``.po`` files are edited by translators
                     (e.g. with poedit_) and updated by scons gettext tool when
                     the ``messages.pot`` changes (when translation strings in
                     source files change, for example),
=================   ==============================================================

The scons gettext tool maintains several ``.po`` files under ``po/`` directory,
one file per language. Note, that the ``.po`` files are being updated by scons
in source directory and **should be commited back** to source repository.

The typical translator's activities are:

- update particular ``.po`` file, e.g. ``src/lib/numbo/app/clinfo/po/pl.po``::

      scons src/lib/numbo/app/clinfo/po/pl.po

- update all translation files in project::

      scons po-update

- initialize new target language (new ``.po`` file), e.g. add "pl" language to
  ``src/lib/numbo/app/clinfo/po/``::
    
      echo "pl" >> src/lib/numbo/app/clinfo/po/LINGUAS
      scons po-update

  and follow instructions printed by scons.

- edit translations by editing particular ``.po`` file with poedit_

Typical maintainer/developer activities:

- add new source files to ``POTFILES.in``; actually all ``.cpp`` and ``.hpp``
  files for given subpackage should be listed in ``POTFILES.in``,
- updating ``messages.pot`` files in project (e.g. after changing the content
  of ``POTFILES.in`` or after modifying internationalized strings in source
  files)::

        scons pot-update
